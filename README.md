# Solar-insightz-mobile-app
## Mobile app for the company Zimpertec
This project was made for the company Zimpertec. They provided us with specifications and our 4 people student team programmed the mobile app.
We used React Native as our language, as our client wanted the app to work on both Android and Ios.
###
We were not allowed to show the actual data used for this project, so I had to remove the exel file and .json files parsed from it. 
A video of the app in use is included to demonstrate the fucntionalities and UI design.
